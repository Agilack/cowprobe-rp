Cowprobe-rp : Firmware
======================

This folder contains the code of the main cowprbe-rp firmware. The current
(initial) version is very basic with only serial port available (based on
the code of another project: cowprobe).

To compile this firmware, the lastest stable version of RP2040 SDK (1.4.0) must
be installed first (see raspberry-pi website). The compiler used for development
is GCC 10.3.
